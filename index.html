            <h2>What is Photography?</h2>
            <p>
              Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating
              durable images by recording light, either electronically by means
              of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive
              material such as photographic film. It is employed in many fields
              of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business,
              as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video
              production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication.
              Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted
              from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface
              inside a camera during a timed exposure. With an electronic image
              sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is
              electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for
              subsequent display or processing. The result with photographic
              emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically
              "developed" into a visible image, either negative or positive,
              depending on the purpose of the photographic material and the
              method of processing. A negative image on film is traditionally
              used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base,
              known as a print, either by using an enlarger or by contact
              printing.

            <h2>Etymology</h2>
            <p>
              The word "photography" was created from the Greek roots φωτός
              (phōtós), genitive of φῶς (phōs), "light" and γραφή (graphé)
              "representation by means of lines" or "drawing", together meaning
              "drawing with light". Several people may have coined the same new
              term from these roots independently. Hercules Florence, a French
              painter and inventor living in Campinas, Brazil, used the French
              form of the word, photographie, in private notes which a Brazilian
              historian believes were written in 1834. This claim is widely
              reported but is not yet largely recognized internationally. The
              first use of the word by the Franco-Brazilian inventor became
              widely known after the research of Boris Kossoy in 1980. The
              German newspaper Vossische Zeitung of 25 February 1839 contained
              an article entitled Photographie, discussing several priority
              claims especially Henry Fox Talbot's regarding Daguerre's claim of
              invention. The article is the earliest known occurrence of the
              word in public print. It was signed "J.M.", believed to have been
              Berlin astronomer Johann von Maedler. The astronomer Sir John
              Herschel is also credited with coining the word, independent of
              Talbot, in 1839. The inventors Nicéphore Niépce, Henry Fox Talbot
              and Louis Daguerre seem not to have known or used the word
              "photography", but referred to their processes as "Heliography"
              (Niépce), "Photogenic Drawing"/"Talbotype"/"Calotype" (Talbot) and
              "Daguerreotype" (Daguerre).

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
              Photography is the result of combining several technical
              discoveries, relating to seeing an image and capturing the image.
              The discovery of the camera obscura ("dark chamber" in Latin) that
              provides an image of a scene dates back to ancient China. Greek
              mathematicians Aristotle and Euclid independently described a
              camera obscura in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE. In the 6th
              century CE, Byzantine mathematician Anthemius of Tralles used a
              type of camera obscura in his experiments. The Arab physicist Ibn
              al-Haytham (Alhazen) (965-1040) also invented a camera obscura as
              well as the first true pinhole camera. The invention of the camera
              has been traced back to the work of Ibn al-Haytham. While the
              effects of a single light passing through a pinhole had been
              described earlier, Ibn al-Haytham gave the first correct analysis
              of the camera obscura,including the first geometrical and
              quantitative descriptions of the phenomenon, and was the first to
              use a screen in a dark room so that an image from one side of a
              hole in the surface could be projected onto a screen on the other
              side. He also first understood the relationship between the focal
              point and the pinhole, and performed early experiments with
              afterimages, laying the foundations for the invention of
              photography in the 19th century. Leonardo da Vinci mentions
              natural camerae obscurae that are formed by dark caves on the edge
              of a sunlit valley. A hole in the cave wall will act as a pinhole
              camera and project a laterally reversed, upside down image on a
              piece of paper. Renaissance painters used the camera obscura
              which, in fact, gives the optical rendering in color that
              dominates Western Art. It is a box with a small hole in one side,
              which allows specific light rays to enter, projecting an inverted
              image onto a viewing screen or paper. The birth of photography was
              then concerned with inventing means to capture and keep the image
              produced by the camera obscura. Albertus Magnus (1193-1280)
              discovered silver nitrate, and Georg Fabricius (1516-1571)
              discovered silver chloride, and the techniques described in Ibn
              al-Haytham's Book of Optics are capable of producing primitive
              photographs using medieval materials. Daniele Barbaro described a
              diaphragm in 1566. Wilhelm Homberg described how light darkened
              some chemicals (photochemical effect) in 1694. The fiction book
              Giphantie, published in 1760, by French author Tiphaigne de la
              Roche, described what can be interpreted as photography. Around
              the year 1800, British inventor Thomas Wedgwood made the first
              known attempt to capture the image in a camera obscura by means of
              a light-sensitive substance. He used paper or white leather
              treated with silver nitrate. Although he succeeded in capturing
              the shadows of objects placed on the surface in direct sunlight,
              and even made shadow copies of paintings on glass, it was reported
              in 1802 that "the images formed by means of a camera obscura have
              been found too faint to produce, in any moderate time, an effect
              upon the nitrate of silver." The shadow images eventually darkened
              all over.
